Project Vision

Player: 
The player will be able to move in two speeds, one faster speed used for most maneuvering and then a slower speed useful for precise movements. The player will be able to shoot a basic bullet attack but can also collect power ups to perform more unique attacks. The player will be able to take 3 hits before dying, causing the game to be over. Hit detection will utilize a visible hitbox that is also a part of the player. 

Enemies:
Most basic enemies will be able to move around the screen given their movement pattern, shoot bullets, and take 1 hit before dying. Furthermore, grunts can be made unique by building them with different properties such as health, movement type, bullet type, sprite and color. Finally, throughout the game, different types of grunts will be used to shoot bullets in different ways and patterns, such as basic downward shots, circular pattern shots, triangular pattern shots, or special shots like lasers that block a longer portion of the screen.

Mid Boss:
The mid boss will be a significant enemy, appearing once during a particular point in the game. This enemy will have a unique sprite, movement pattern, bullet, and health bar. It will take more hits than a typical grunt, but less than the final boss.

Boss:
The boss is another significant enemy, appearing towards the end of the game. This enemy will also have a unique sprite, movement pattern, bullet, and health bar. The boss will also have different “stages” each triggered after a certain threshold of health has been lost. This will be indicated by the health bar. Each stage will also change the boss’s movement pattern and bullets.

Bullets: 
The player will have access to a basic shot at all times, but can obtain power ups for different attacks. Ideas for power ups include a spread shot attack that shoots out three basic bullets, a laser attack which is larger and does more damage, and a bomb which clears out enemy bullets from the screen. All bullets will include a unique sprite and movement pattern type.


Gameplay:

The game will be divided up into four sections: a grunt phase, a midboss, more grunts, and then a final boss stage. The player can move using the arrow keys, and use the slower movement feature by holding a specific key. The player’s 3 lives will be displayed on the screen, losing one each time damage is taken. The screen will also display gametime, power-up, and score. Score is increased upon defeating enemies, while power-ups are obtained after defeating certain enemies like bosses.

Additional features
Other features we plan on implementing in the game is a cheat mode that allows the player to be invincible, a functional menu that allows the player to configure keys and maybe select difficulty 

From 0:01 - 0:45
Several waves of two types of grunts will spawn on the screen, following their specific movement patterns and shooting bullets. The grunts' initial positions will differ between waves as well as the amounts spawned at once. The first type of grunt will shoot a triangular-pattern of bullets towards the player while moving from one side of the screen to the other. The second type of grunt will shoot single bullets towards the player while remaining still. There is also a variation of this grunt that simply moves across the screen but does not shoot.

From 0:48 - 1:15
The mid-boss will spawn at this point, moving and shooting at the player. The mid boss’s hp bar will also be displayed on the screen. Its bullets will shoot out in a circular pattern outward from the boss in intervals of 3 waves as well as shooting out a fan of bullets downwards towards the player. Grunts will also spawn towards the end of this period, shooting the triangular-pattern of bullets towards the player. At the end of the time period, the boss will be removed if not killed.

From 1:18 - 1:29
More waves of grunts will spawn, similar to the beginning of the game.

From 1:32 - *
The final boss spawns on the screen, beginning with stage 1. An hp bar will also appear for this stage. The first stage involves the boss shooting a laser pattern of bullets similar to the gameplay sample video. Additionally, bullets will periodically be shot out from the boss’s origin in a circular, rotating pattern. The boss will also occasionally move to different points of the screen.

After depleting the health bar, it will reset, starting stage 2.
During this stage, the boss will continue to move the same as stage one, but no longer shoot the laser pattern of bullets. The new bullet pattern will be a circular one that grows outwards from the boss’s origin, each shot having two waves of bullets.

After depleting the health bar again, it will reset for stage 3. 
This stage is similar to stage 1 but faster, as well as the laser pattern being larger.
Finally, the health bar will reset once more for stage 4.

In the fourth stage, the boss will continue to move the same, with bullets shooting out in a scattered pattern all around the boss. There are also longer line-shaped bullets that periodically shoot out from around the boss.
The boss is killed after the last hp bar is emptied.
